        bio: `<p>Voice, Words and Speaking have always been a passion for Kate – probably the result of growing up a preacher’s daughter in the South. &nbsp; A simple conversation with her father led Kate to offering her services as a coach and consultant in the areas of Public Speaking, Presence and Communication.</p><p>Kate attained her Masters of Fine Arts from DePaul University in Chicago, Illinois. Upon graduation she returned to Louisville and began looking for a way to put her 20 years of training and stage and film experience to good use.&nbsp;Since taking her first client, &nbsp;word of Kate’s work has spread quickly. Her work with clients has taken her to Pittsburgh, San Francisco, Minnesota and beyond.</p><p>Kate remains active in Stage and Film work ~ which always keeps her close to the technique and discipline of voice. It also serves as a reminder of the power of the human voice and ts ability to evoke emotion, inspire action and captivate an audience.</p><p>The Speaker’s Studio uses Theatre and Improv to develop Public Speaking, Presentation and Leadership Skills.</p><p>Through Individual Coaching, Workshops and Classes The Speaker’s Studio coaches young professionals and seasoned executives to take risks, expand their horizons and adopt new, more effective habits for continued success.</p><p></p>`,

        bio: `<p>Shauvon McGill tries not to think of himself as a modern day renaissance man. However, he apparently isn’t trying terribly hard since he just used it in that last sentence. As cliche and contrived as the term might be, it’s hard to choose a more apt description. Whether he is composing music, developing computer programs, writing, cooking, taking pictures, performing, or working on countless projects around his house, Shauvon loves exploring as many different things as possible. This variety of experience lends a unique perspective to one of his greatest passions: Improv. Shauvon has studied improvisation and comedy for 12 years across the Midwest, including time studying at the Second City Conservatory in Chicago. He approaches every day with the philosophies of Improv in mind, and is most comfortable when he’s out on a limb, flying by the seat of his pants, and coming up with other metaphors for things. He has no qualms about diving head-first into things he’s never done before. In fact, that may be his favorite thing to do. Well, that and Lego.</p>`,
