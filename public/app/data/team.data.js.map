He also also does a lot of wondering about Things and generally trying not to get too bothered about them. Shauvon once managed to come up with a few Very Good Jokes, and he knew that they were Very Good because they were in a dream that was all about how Very Good Jokes they were. Being that they were in a dream, Shauvon can't really remember the Jokes (only how Very Good they were), so I suppose you had to be there. Shauvon usually tries avoiding the things he can't do, but sometimes he forgets he can't do them and does them anyway. As a great philosopher once said, \\\"A fly can't bird, but a bird can fly.
