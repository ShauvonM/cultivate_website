However, he apparently isn’t trying terribly hard since he just used it in that last sentence. As cliche and contrived as the term might be, it’s hard to choose a more apt description. Whether he is composing music, developing computer programs, writing, cooking, taking pictures, performing, or working on countless projects around his house, Shauvon loves exploring as many different things as possible. This variety of experience lends a unique perspective to one of his greatest passions: Improv. Shauvon has studied improvisation and comedy for 12 years across the Midwest, including time studying at the Second City Conservatory in Chicago. He approaches every day with the philosophies of Improv in mind, and is most comfortable when he’s out on a limb, flying by the seat of his pants, and coming up with other metaphors for things. He has no qualms about diving head-first into things he’s never done before. In fact, that may be his favorite thing to do. Well, that and Lego.</p>`,\r\n        website: 'http://www.denyconformity.com',\r\n        email: 'shauvon@cultivatelouisville.com',\r\n        phone: 3174164500\r\n    },\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        key: 'gil',\r\n        firstName: 'Gil',\r\n        lastName: 'Reyes',\r\n        bio: `\r\n        <p>Gil Reyes is co-founder and Co-Artistic Director of [502] and Senior Manager of External Affairs at The Kentucky Science Center.
