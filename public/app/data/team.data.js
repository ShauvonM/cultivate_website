        founder: true,
        bio: "<p>Shauvon spends most of his time creating computer programs, turning Nothing into a slightly different sort of Nothing, and also surrounding himself with thousands of Lego pieces. He also also does a lot of wondering about Things and generally trying not to get too bothered about them. Shauvon once managed to come up with a few Very Good Jokes, and he knew that they were Very Good because they were in a dream that was all about how Very Good Jokes they were. Being that they were in a dream, Shauvon can't really remember the Jokes (only how Very Good they were), so I suppose you had to be there. Shauvon usually tries avoiding the things he can't do, but sometimes he forgets he can't do them and does them anyway. As a great philosopher once said, \"A fly can't bird, but a bird can fly. Ask me a riddle and I reply: Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottleston pie.\"</p>",
